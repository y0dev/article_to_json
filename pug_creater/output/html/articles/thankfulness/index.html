          <h2 class="section-title">Command for Thankfulness</h2>
          <p class="post-details">We seldom give thanks during all seasons of life. We give praises to God when things are well as we should, but not when things aren’t. Prime example of this in scripture is Israel’s ungrateful heart throughout their time in the wilderness (Num. 14:1-4;20:3-5). Also, remember this is after God hears their groaning in Egypt and rescues them out of the harness that they faced while there (Ex. 2:24-25).</p>
          <p class="post-details">The harshness that the Israelites faced in Egypt was bad and continued to get worse as Pharaoh saw how they were multiplying (Ex. 1:8-15). Even when God had blessed Israel abundantly with manna and protection in the wilderness, they still thought it was better to go back and enjoy the life they had there with all the food (Num. 11:5). They’re not the only ones that think this way.</p>
          <p class="post-details">As I read Col. 3:15, Paul commands the saints in Colossae to be thankful. This would seem like a weird command because you would think that we should always be thankful. Paul here reminds the believer to be thankful after just telling them to put on these godly characteristics (Col. 3:12-14). Why should we then be thankful? Why this command? I believe Paul wants us to remember the mercy of God in saving us from the bondage of sin that once enslaved us. The believer may grumble about these characteristics that they have to put off (Col. 3:5-11) which they prided themselves in having before the saving grace of Christ or because they’ve been wrong by someone and that person deserves it. As I was reminded by a brother, “We deserve much worse than what this person just said about us even though it may not be true.” God did not need to save Israel from Egypt nor did he need to save us from our sins.</p>
          <p class="post-details">So, to close as the Apostle Paul commands, “Be Thankful”. We ought to always be thankful in all circumstances because we deserve much more than we are receiving.</p>

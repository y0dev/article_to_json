          <p class="post-details">These are the following learning that I was grateful to learn about this week: </p>
          <ol>
            <li class="post-list-item">Doxologies of the NT ascribe the same glory and honor to Christ as was the commonality to ascribe to God in the OT (1 Chr. 29:10-11;1 Pet. 4:11;2 Pet. 3:18)</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">Jesus instructs His disciples to pray to Him(Jh. 14:14;15:16;16:23-24) and we look at those passage we see that He describes Himself as our mediator between God and man</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">Christ in emptying Himself in Phil. 2 did not empty Himself of His deity, but rather emptying by addition, not subtraction, by becoming man</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">The Son of God fully possessed His divine nature, attributes, and prerogatives, he did not fully express them. They were veiled to be revealed by Him when he wanted</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">Christ surrender the glories from which He came, from being worshipped by saints and angels to mocked by men</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">Both Jesus's divine nature and human nature possesses their own will. (Jh. 17:24) His divine will; (Mat. 26:39) His human will</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">His limited knowledge such as in passage like Mark 13 is a result of His voluntary surrender of the independent use of His divine attributes</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">Jesus was baptized in order to fulfill the Father's will. He in turned identified Himself with sinners to ultimately bear their sins</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">Jesus veiling the truth in parables acted as both judgement and mercy for the hearers. Judgement because it kept them in darkness and mercy because He grant them to see the light of God</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">God prepared mankind for the atoning substitutionary sacrifice;of Christ by providing the instructions about sacrifice</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">The display of Jesus's glory is most often associated with His second advent, not His resurrection</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">Glory in the minds of the prophets and apostles were mostly associated with Christ's resurrection</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">The believers resurrection they share in the same glory</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">Every believer is ultimately accountable to him (1 Cor. 3:10-15) which motivates us to please God</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">At the fullness of time, God will gather together believers in the millennial kingdom</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">The real glory of eternity is when believers will reside in the presence of the Lord</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="post-details">I still have questions on the following: </p>
          <ol>
            <li class="post-list-item">Is this denial from this British monk the reason why so many believe in free will?</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">In understanding the a-mil or post-mil position on the end times, how can it be that the man of lawlessness isn't literally or has already come and deceived?</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">Why was the woman promised the coming seed that would reverse the curse?</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">Why did God not destroy all man again as he did in the flood even though man remained sinful as we see even Noah was sinful?</li>
          </ol>

          <p class="post-details">Since the enlightenment, humans have thought of themselves as inherently "good".</p>
          <p class="post-details">These are the following learning that I was grateful to learn about this week in my study on humans and sin: </p>
          <ol>
            <li class="post-list-item">Anthropology helps me with understanding who I am as a person. This answers the question of why we all are here.</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">Anthropology also helps with dealing with the time such as what Charles Spurgen dealt with evolution starting with Charles Darwin. This is where I am happy to learn about sudden creationism</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">I noticed while going through Genesis 1 were the terms created, made, and formed. This was eye opening because I sometimes can gloss over these terms while reading and miss God's magnificent glory in creation</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">Imago Dei is a unique difference that we humans possess that all other creatures and animals don't possess. We are his representation not in the divine sense, but in the sense of the Trinitrian nature how we live in relationship with others</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">Our conscience can get overridden by lies and errors which in turn misinforms the conscience</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">Scripture seems to support dichotomy and trichotomy where sometimes soul and spirit are interchangeable and other times they are not so interchangeable, but mean different things</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">Creationism argument when it comes to the origin of the soul fails to understand that Adam creation is a unique creation, so using him for the argument that both the soul and body were created at the same time is wrong.</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">Deut. 22:5 supports that God expects that said person to live according to the gender He granted them at birth</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">After the creatures were created God seemed to still create Adam a helper, so we see that the creatures and animals weren't suitable for him</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">Homosexual unions cannot be rightly seen as marriages because it goes against God meaning for marriage: 
              <ul class="sublist">
                <li class="post-sublist-item">He create man and seen that man needed a companion and this companion must fulfill His command to procreate</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="post-list-item">Ex. 21:22-25 presents a strong case for life starting in the womb because of the severity of the punishment if the child in the mother is harmed.</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">The soul/spirit lives in an intermediate state between death and bodily resurrection</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="post-details">I still have questions on the following: </p>
          <ol>
            <li class="post-list-item">Can one human constitution affect another human constitution?</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">Similar to man initial command and go and fill the earth which they disobey which led to Gen. 11 in which they gathered in one place; is our command to go and make disciples of all nations can we be disobedient if we stick to trying to make disciples and our household and extended families?</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">When talking about the role of government, is it wrong to disobey when they constitute something as being wrong such as the latest Canadian bill even though they are in place to punish people who do wrong?</li>
          </ol>

          <p class="post-details">Here's what I learned this week studying the attributes/perfections of God: </p>
          <ol>
            <li class="post-list-item">God is not dependent on no one or nothing. This is a common thought that we as human love to think that we can give something to God or God is somehow wouldn't be God if we don't choose Him for our salvation</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">God's immutability, this is something that I would've used to an Arminian brother or sister in understanding that since God doesn't change and He has decreed His elect from the being. I thought this would've been a good argument, but reading this section understanding that open theist and their disbelief in God's immutability.</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">Immutability does not mean that God is static, nor that He doesn't act distinctly in time or possess true affections</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">Anthropopathic language is God's figurative expression of how He explains His change in actions towards a person</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">His infinitude with regard to time is eternity, and His infinitude with regard to space is omnipresence</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">God can experience time, but he is not controlled, confined, or condition by time</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">God upholds the created order by being in every point of space</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">God does know what would have happened if circumstances would have been different, but they aren't possible because they are not apart of God's plan</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">God's knowledge is perfect He is never learning, so He does not have to look into the future to see how would accept His salvation</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">God's knowledge has two aspects: Natural knowledge and free knowledge: 
              <ul class="sublist">
                <li class="post-sublist-item">Natural Knowledge: is His self-conscious knowledge of Himself</li>
                <li class="post-sublist-item">Free Knowledge: all things that become known in time by His sovereign will, all things that do not become known in time, and how He is manifested and not manifested by all things outside of Him</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="post-list-item">His natural knowledge is how He reveals himself to creation</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">We as creation can know God through His free knowledge because He decrees of how He would reveal Himself to creation</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">God's foreknowledge is not dependent on foresight of what humans would do</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">Scripture reveals God's power (Eph. 3:20)</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">God's power is that he has a theoretical absolute power to do more than what He actually does but not inconsistent with His essence</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">Doctrine of divine perfection is the doctrine of divine blessedness</li>

          <p class="post-details">These are the following learning that I was grateful to learn about this week: </p>
          <ol>
            <li class="post-list-item">Christ is eternally begotten from the Father, this is not speaking that Christ had a beginning because that goes against John 1:2-3</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">Begotten in an eternal sense is speaking of the relationship of the First and Second person of the Trinity</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">The Holy Spirit is not begotten, but rather procession</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">When talking about order in the Trinity we are not speaking of glory, majesty, or essence, but rather with relationship</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">The word Trinity is not found in found in Scripture but it is based on the biblical verbiage presented</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">The doctrine of the Trinity was formally articulated by the Councils of Nicea(AD 325) and Constantinople(AD 381), but weren't invented here</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">The term arised to combat heresies that were arising from Gnosticism and Monarchianism</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">Christ (Second person of the Trinity) was sent from the Father as a result of God's love for mankind (John 3:16)</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">Christ has always existed as the Son of God but became a child only at the moment of His miraculous conception</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">"Son of God" title was understood categorically by everyone as a title of deity</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">Theophany meaning appearance of God usually is referred to the old testament and are seen in passage like Gen. 16: 7-3 and has to be seen through the author rather than the character</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">As we read John 1:18 we see that "no one has seen God...,he has made him known" made known in greek ( ex geomai )</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">Jesus (the Son of God) made the Father known to mankind</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">We see Christ intervening in history when mankind rebelled along with establishing the Kingdom of God on earth</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">The point of the word "God-breathed" points to the origin of Scripture which is the divine breath of the Holy Spirit</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">The Son of God appears as the one speaking to the people both in the OT and NT</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">Christ is the theophany giving revelation by means of His personal presence</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">The Spirit plays a key role in the prophets' recording of the revelation they seen</li>
            <li class="post-list-item">He who is the Word of God speaks all thing into existence and pronounces judgement</li>

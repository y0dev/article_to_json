					p.post-details Ever wonder why Navy SEALs are some of the world's most elite warriors? It's as simple as "breathing" literally. According to the Lung Association of Canada, we take on average 22,000 breaths a day. Wow, we take 22,000 breaths a day and don't give thanks for even a quarter of it.
					p.post-details Thanks God for His mercy to allow us to take these breaths! Psalm 136

						figcaption.post-image-caption Box Breathing
					p.post-details We can do a lot to help ourselves by practicing better breathing patterns. There are many different breathing patterns that can result in more energy and a clearer head. The well known breathing pattern is known as "Box Breathing". In this pattern you would exhale and inhale for the same duration around a box so to speak. 
					ol
						li.post-list-item Inhale along the left for 4 seconds
						li.post-list-item Exhale along the top for 4 seconds
						li.post-list-item Inside the along the right for 4 seconds
						li.post-list-item Exhale along the bottom for 4 seconds
					p.post-details Box breathing helps you deal effectively with stress and anxiety. It also brings balance to your body and mind along with regulating your natural heart rhythm.

					h2.section-title Training
					p.post-details Navy Seals train in such a way to help them control their breathing not only to stay calm, but to also conserve energy. It starts with breathing and proper breathing. Proper breathing begins with breathing through the nose and out the mouth. We heard this before early in our sports career. Little that we know, that is very beneficial to our health. The benefits are: 
					ul
						li.post-list-item Reduces exposure to foreign substances
						li.post-list-item Increases oxygen uptake and circulation
						li.post-list-item Aids our immune system
						li.post-list-item Slows down breathing
						li.post-list-item Improves lung volume
						li.post-list-item Humidifies inhaled air
					p.post-details Here is a workout or things to do while working out that I believe will help with teaching yourself proper breathing and self control. 100s of pushups, burpees and squats. While at the bottom of a squat just breathe deep inhales, so that you will fill your lungs and slow exhales. The reasoning behind this is because shallow breaths leads to: 
					ul
						li.post-list-item Increased blood pressure
						li.post-list-item Increased stress response
						li.post-list-item Reduced oxygen intake
						li.post-list-item Impaired thinking
						li.post-list-item Slower recovery
					p.post-details While running, fill your lungs by breathing in through your nose only after each run or after each set. Sharp inhales through the nose and soft exhales through the mouth or nose.

					p.post-details Start small! 
					ol
						li.post-list-item Break up your big goals into small chunks, one breath at a time
						li.post-list-item Breath control is stress control

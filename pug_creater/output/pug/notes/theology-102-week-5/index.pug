					p.post-details These are the following learning that I was grateful to learn about this week: 
					ol
						li.post-list-item Christ is eternally begotten from the Father, this is not speaking that Christ had a beginning because that goes against John 1:2-3
						li.post-list-item Begotten in an eternal sense is speaking of the relationship of the First and Second person of the Trinity
						li.post-list-item The Holy Spirit is not begotten, but rather procession
						li.post-list-item When talking about order in the Trinity we are not speaking of glory, majesty, or essence, but rather with relationship
						li.post-list-item The word Trinity is not found in found in Scripture but it is based on the biblical verbiage presented
						li.post-list-item The doctrine of the Trinity was formally articulated by the Councils of Nicea(AD 325) and Constantinople(AD 381), but weren't invented here
						li.post-list-item The term arised to combat heresies that were arising from Gnosticism and Monarchianism
						li.post-list-item Christ (Second person of the Trinity) was sent from the Father as a result of God's love for mankind (John 3:16)
						li.post-list-item Christ has always existed as the Son of God but became a child only at the moment of His miraculous conception
						li.post-list-item "Son of God" title was understood categorically by everyone as a title of deity
						li.post-list-item Theophany meaning appearance of God usually is referred to the old testament and are seen in passage like Gen. 16: 7-3 and has to be seen through the author rather than the character
						li.post-list-item As we read John 1:18 we see that "no one has seen God...,he has made him known" made known in greek ( ex geomai )
						li.post-list-item Jesus (the Son of God) made the Father known to mankind
						li.post-list-item We see Christ intervening in history when mankind rebelled along with establishing the Kingdom of God on earth
						li.post-list-item The point of the word "God-breathed" points to the origin of Scripture which is the divine breath of the Holy Spirit
						li.post-list-item The Son of God appears as the one speaking to the people both in the OT and NT
						li.post-list-item Christ is the theophany giving revelation by means of His personal presence
						li.post-list-item The Spirit plays a key role in the prophets' recording of the revelation they seen
						li.post-list-item He who is the Word of God speaks all thing into existence and pronounces judgement

					p.post-details These are the following learning that I was grateful to learn about this week: 
					ol
						li.post-list-item Satan can serve God's purposes in the realm of church discipline when repentance remains absent
						li.post-list-item Believers are to gird up the loins with truth which show they have a heart for battle because of their commitment to Christ
						li.post-list-item God has provided the breastplate of righteousness to protect the believer's mind and emotions
						li.post-list-item Though Satan and one-third of the angel disqualified themselves from servest to the LORD, they weren't completely banned from heaven
						li.post-list-item Satan will only bruise Christ heel (cause Him to suffer), while Christ will bruise Satan's head (destroy him with a fatal blow)
						li.post-list-item When someone is demonize, the demon exercise living and dominant control over that person
						li.post-list-item The sealing ministry of the Holy Spirit protects Christians against demon invasion, and its unbiblical and impossible for a true believer to have a demon invasion
						li.post-list-item Demonization refers to the only unbelievers in whom a demon resides
						li.post-list-item Believers can be tormented, oppressed, and harassed externally, even to to severe degree like Saul
						li.post-list-item A demon is far more powerful than a human so we must trust the appeal to God in prayer to deal with situation of demonization
						li.post-list-item The angel of the LORD has been identified as a special created angel, some say Michael the archangel, but no created angel has ever show traits of deity
						li.post-list-item Also the angel of the LORD is a self-manifestation of Yahweh himself
						li.post-list-item The angel of the LORD showed traits of deity (Ex, 3:2-5; Judg. 13:17-18; Ex. 23:21;33:14; Isa. 63:9)
						li.post-list-item The identification of the angel of the LORD matches the NT explanation of the preincarnate Christ
						li.post-list-item The words uttered by Christ asserts that He was the angel of the LORD mentioned in the OT because it asserts that more than one person can be God
						li.post-list-item The attributes of the OT angel of the LORD compare perfectly with those of Christ
					p.post-details I still have questions on the following: 
					ol
						li.post-list-item How can demons be pictured in today's age, such as in a homeless person who is talking to themselves, or can it be your average person?
						li.post-list-item If one is demon possessed what do we do as Christians?
						li.post-list-item Will the Antichrist be some type of leader like the king of Babylon in Isaiah 14?
						li.post-list-item What portion in man's sinful action is Satan or demon deception; or just the man's own sinfulness? (The Devil made me do it theology)

					p.post-details These are the following learning that I was grateful to learn about this week: 
					ol
						li.post-list-item Angels(both holy and evil) were created at the start of creation and the demons fell somewhere after the seven day creation and prior to the fall. They existed with a set number and 1/3 of them falling
						li.post-list-item The term “heaven” in scripture describes three different elevation levels above earth.
						li.post-list-item “Third heaven” normally known as paradise where God resides
						li.post-list-item “Second heaven” where the sun, moon, and stars reside
						li.post-list-item “First heaven” earth's atmosphere
						li.post-list-item Angels are ministering spirits this is presented in Heb. 1:14
						li.post-list-item “God of this world” is Satan and he has superior power, but not deity. This title comes by virtue not his position nor his nature. The reason behind the title is Satan's work in the garden that cause the fall, and he is behind all false religions
						li.post-list-item Satan's messages and activities are all built on deception and lies (1 Ki. 22:21-23)
						li.post-list-item God used Satan to deceive Israel's King Ahab to go into battle which led to Ahab's death
						li.post-list-item Satan and other demonic minions were most intensely engaged during Christ's earthly ministry
						li.post-list-item Satan operates as the unrivaled master of disguise who also mimics and imitates the holy things of God, but gives his cheap version, which lures people to himself
						li.post-list-item Satan wages an invisible spiritual war using deceitful and clever tactics
						li.post-list-item Satan's target is the human mind more importantly the Christian's mind as he plays mind games with them
						li.post-list-item Satan attempt to distort or deny the truth God's Word by sensualism, sensationalism, universalism, rationalism, existentialism, illusionism, ecumenism, humanism
						li.post-list-item The question that Satan asked Eve in the garden was not a research question, but rather a ridicule
						li.post-list-item Ex: You've got to be kidding, Eve. God didn't really say you can't eat from any tree in the garden, did he?
						li.post-list-item In the moment when Eve was deceived God's Word was no longer authoritative in her life now that she had an alternative
					p.post-details I still have questions on the following: 
					ol
						li.post-list-item How can demons be pictured in today's age, such as in a homeless person who is talking to themselves, or can it be your average person?
						li.post-list-item If one is demon possessed what do we do as Christians?
						li.post-list-item Will the Antichrist be some type of leader like the king of Babylon in Isaiah 14?
						li.post-list-item What portion in man’s sinful action is Satan or demon deception; or just the man’s own sinfulness? (The Devil made me do it theology)

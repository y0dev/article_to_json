Well, Docker is a software platform for building applications based on containers. Containers are small and lightweight execution environments that make shared use of the operating system kernel but otherwise run in isolation from one another. What is the difference between an image and a container? An image is a portable, read-only, executable file containing the instructions for creating a container. This image gets created using a dockerfile. What is also included in these instructions are operating system, languages, environmental variables, file locations, network ports, and any other components it needs to run.",
